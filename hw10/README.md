With this App, I have tried to give the individual a friendly interface in which they can perform their own sentiment analysis and examine any questions pertaining to this data set on campaign speeches. Individuals can modify the speaker, the sentiment value, and the date in examinning the differences in campaign speeches. Based upon the input they decide, they will receive a graph of the percentage of speeches that each speaker used given the parameters, a count of how many words are within their parameters for each speaker, and the given words that are within their parameters.

You can find the application here:

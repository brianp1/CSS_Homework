# Homework 02: Exploring and Wrangling Data

See detailed instructions for this homework assignment [here](https://uc-cfss.github.io/hw02-explore-wrangle-data.html).

Your assignment should be submitted as three RMarkdown documents. Make sure you've read the chapter on [R Markdown](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) so you understand how to properly use these files.

In the [`demo`](demo/) folder I have included some example solutions:

* [Gun deaths solution](demo/gun_deaths_solution.md)
* [Tidying `dadmom` solution](demo/dadmom_solution.md)
* [SCOTUS solution](demo/scotus_solution.md)


Follow instructions on [homework workflow](https://uc-cfss.github.io/hw00_homework_guidelines.html#homework_workflow) to submit your homework. As part of the pull request, you're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.
